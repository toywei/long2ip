A long integer is a way of saving an IP address as a number in a database. A number is easier to use than an IP address in databases when making comparisons. 

An IP address consists of 4 numbers that are divided by points, for example 8.8.8.8. 

An IP address is "base 256", and to convert the IP address 8.8.8.8.to decimal (base 10) we use the following formula: 

8 x (256)^3 + 8 x (256)^2 + 8 x (256)^1 + 8 (256)^0
